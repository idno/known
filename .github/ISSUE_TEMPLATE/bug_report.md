## Some other notes:

Give us some context: 

* It'd also be really handy if you could tell us the contents of your ```version.known``` file
* What database are you using? (e.g. mongo, mysql, postgres)
* Any warnings or errors in your admin/diagnostics page?
* If this is a programming bug, can you include examples of any Micropub / API calls / webhook pings you make? Otherwise please don't worry about what this means!
* Bonus points - are you able to illustrate the issue with a unit test? If so, submit it as a pull request!
