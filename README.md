# Idno: a social publishing platform

![Idno - A social publishing platform](https://withknown.com/img/home/screens.png)

## Installation 

Idno is under active development and requires PHP 8.3+ with selected extensions, together with a supported database backend. You can find detailed installation instructions here: <http://docs.idno.co/en/latest/install/index.html>

#### Installing from packages

_Unofficial_ install packages, which are periodically built from the latest code, are available: <https://www.marcus-povey.co.uk/known/>

#### Installing from Github

You can opt to check out the work-in-progress development code from the git repository: <https://github.com/idno/idno>

* Check out the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/idno/idno.git```
* Fetch dependencies: ```cd idno; composer install```

#### Installing with composer

You can install Idno directly from composer using: ``` composer create-project idno/idno ```

Optionally, you can install the latest bleeding edge code the same way: ``` composer create-project idno/idno -s dev ```

### Setting up the async pipeline

By default, Idno processes events **synchronously** — that is, things like
Webmention pings, syndication, and ActivityPub delivery all happen inside the
web request that triggered them. This works, but it makes page saves slow and
means a timeout or crash loses the work.

Enabling the **asynchronous queue** moves all of that into a background worker.
The web request just drops an event into the database and returns immediately;
the worker picks it up and processes it separately.

**This is required for ActivityPub.** Follow-accept delivery,
post distribution to followers, and update/delete propagation are all
dispatched through the queue. If the worker is not running, those events
sit in the database unprocessed and remote servers will never receive them.

#### 1. Enable the async queue

Add this line to your `config.ini`:

```ini
event_queue = 'AsynchronousQueue'
```

Without this line (or with the default `SynchronousQueue`), all events are
processed inline during the web request.

#### 2. Start the event queue worker

```bash
sudo -u www-data IDNO_DOMAIN='your.domain' ./idno.php service-event-queue
```

| Option       | Default   | Description                                |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `--queue`    | `default` | Named queue to process                     |
| `--interval` | `1`       | Seconds to sleep between polling cycles    |

**How it works:** The worker runs an infinite loop. Each cycle it:

1. Queries the database for up to 50 pending events.
2. Dispatches each one via an internal HTTP call to `/service/queue/dispatch/{id}`,
   which triggers the event handler (e.g., signing and POSTing an ActivityPub
   activity to a remote inbox).
3. Runs garbage collection to remove completed events older than 5 minutes.
4. Sleeps for `--interval` seconds, then repeats.

**If the worker dies, queued events pile up in the database but are not lost.**
They will be processed once the worker is restarted.

#### 3. Keep it alive with systemd (recommended)

The worker must stay running permanently. The simplest way is a systemd service
unit. Create `/etc/systemd/system/idno-queue.service`, taking care to replace the
values here with your own paths, users, and domains:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Idno async event queue worker
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=www-data
Environment=IDNO_DOMAIN=your.domain
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/idno
ExecStart=/var/www/idno/idno.php service-event-queue #replace with your path
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then enable and start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now idno-queue
```

Check status any time with:

```bash
sudo systemctl status idno-queue
sudo journalctl -u idno-queue -f   # tail the logs
```

#### Alternative: use cron instead of systemd

If you don't have access to systemd (e.g. shared hosting), you can use cron
instead. The `--once` flag makes the worker process one batch of pending events
and exit, which is ideal for cron:

```
* * * * * sudo -u www-data IDNO_DOMAIN='your.domain' /var/www/idno/idno.php service-event-queue --once >> /var/log/idno-queue.log 2>&1
```

This processes pending events once per minute. Events may take up to 60 seconds
to be delivered (compared to ~1 second with the systemd worker above).

#### 4. Run the periodic cron service (optional)

If you need periodic background tasks (triggered via `cron/minute`,
`cron/hourly`, and `cron/daily` events), start the cron service the same way:

```bash
sudo -u www-data IDNO_DOMAIN='your.domain' ./idno.php service-cron
```

You can create a second systemd unit (`idno-cron.service`) following the same
pattern as above if you want it managed automatically.

#### 5. After updates — restart the workers

When you update Idno core or any plugins, **restart both services** so they
pick up the new code:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart idno-queue idno-cron
```
