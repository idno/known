# Code of Conduct

We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing to the Known project.
As such, we want to make sure that we are clear about our rules as a
community with respect to harassment.

This anti-harassment policy has been adapted from the generic conference
anti-harassment policy, which can be found here:

* http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/index.php?title=Conference_anti-harassment_policy

We also encourage you to use and publish the above anti-harassment policy
for any Known-related events you may choose to run.

As with all aspects of Known, we encourage you to submit suggested changes
via GitHub: https://github.com/idno/Known/

If you're wondering about how you can contribute, please see CONTRIBUTING.md,
or go ahead and email us: hello@withknown.com. We'll be delighted to hear from
you.

## The short version

Known is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Sexual language
and imagery is not appropriate for any aspect of the community, including
chat and mailing lists. Community participants violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the core
team.

## The long version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, religion, sexual images in community spaces, deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing communications of any kind,
sustained disruption of discussions or other community activities,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants
asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the core team may take any
action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion
from the community. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the
core team immediately. The core team can always be emailed at hello@withknown.com.

The core team will be happy to help participants contact any appropriate
moderators, authorities or local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe while they are participating in the
community. We value your contributions.
