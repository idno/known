Checkin
=======

An easy way to check into a geographic location.

Protected Checkins
------------------

Protected checkins will, when enabled for a post, protect your exact checkin location for 24 hours. Logged in users will still be able to see your exact location, as will logged out users after 24 hours have elapsed.

The use case here is for vulnerable people, as well as travel bloggers, backpackers and nomads, who want to share their location but not be particularly precise with the location while they’re there.

So, with this feature, you can check in to a location, but not share your precise location until much later, after you’ve presumably moved on.

Developed as part of the [Indieweb Hackday September 2019](https://summerofhacks.io/#2019:4-indiewebcamp)
