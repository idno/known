# Idno (Known)

Idno is an IndieWeb-first social publishing platform written in PHP. Users publish
notes, articles, photos, events, bookmarks, check-ins, and media on their own
domain and syndicate to social networks. It federates with the Fediverse via
ActivityPub.

## A note about the name

This system was originally called Idno. For a startup in 2014-2026, it was called Known. You
may find references to both in the codebase, but any new code should refer to the
system as Idno.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run the full test suite (core + plugins)
php vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run a single plugin's tests
php vendor/bin/phpunit IdnoPlugins/ActivityPub/Tests/

# PHP syntax check
php -l path/to/File.php
```

- PHPUnit config: `phpunit.xml` (bootstrap: `Tests/_bootstrap.php`)
- Two test suites: `Idno Basic Unit Tests` (`Tests/`) and `Plugins` (`IdnoPlugins/*/Tests/`)
- Tests bootstrap from environment variables `IDNO_DOMAIN` / `IDNO_PORT`
- Tests require a running database; the bootstrap loads `Idno/start.php`

## Architecture

```
Idno/                          Core framework
  Common/                      Base classes (Entity, Page, Plugin, ContentType, Theme)
  Core/                        Singletons & services (Idno, Config, Session, Webmention, etc.)
  Data/                        Database backends (Mongo.php, MySQL.php, AbstractSQL.php)
  Entities/                    Core entity types (User, BaseObject, File, AccessGroup, etc.)
  Pages/                       Built-in page handlers (Account, Admin, Entity, Feed, etc.)

IdnoPlugins/                   First-party content & feature plugins
ConsolePlugins/                CLI service plugins (EventQueueService, CronService, Export)
Themes/                        Visual themes (Cherwell, Solo, Kandinsky, etc.)
Tests/                         Core unit tests
```

### Key design patterns

- **Entity system**: All content inherits from `Idno\Common\Entity` (→ `BaseObject`).
  Entities are stored as documents (MongoDB) or serialized blobs (MySQL). Key
  methods: `save()`, `delete()`, `getByUUID()`, `getActivityStreamsObjectType()`,
  `getFormattedContent()`.
- **Plugin system**: Plugins extend `Idno\Common\Plugin`, register routes via
  `registerPages()`, and content types via `registerContentTypes()`. They hook
  into events (`saved`, `updated`, `deleted`, `syndicate`, etc.) using the
  Symfony EventDispatcher.
- **Page routing**: Toro-style regex routing. Routes registered via
  `Idno::site()->routes()->addRoute($pattern, $handlerClass)`. Page handlers
  extend `Idno\Common\Page` with `getContent()` / `postContent()` methods.
- **Template system**: Twig-based (`HybridTwigTemplate`). Templates are extended
  via `extendTemplate()` to inject plugin UI into shell chrome, admin menus, etc.
- **Async queue**: Events can be processed asynchronously via
  `AsynchronousQueue`. The queue worker runs as a CLI service
  (`ConsolePlugins/EventQueueService`) polling for pending
  `AsynchronousQueuedEvent` entities. **Required for ActivityPub.**

### Database

- **MongoDB** (`Idno\Data\Mongo`) — original backend, stores entities as native documents
- **MySQL** (`Idno\Data\MySQL` extends `AbstractSQL`) — stores entities as JSON blobs
- Configured via `config.ini` (`database` / `dbname` / `dbhost` / etc.)

## Content Plugins

| Plugin | Content type | ActivityPub type | Routes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Status** | Short notes & replies | `Note` | `/status/edit`, `/reply/edit` |
| **Text** | Long-form articles | `Article` | `/entry/edit` |
| **Photo** | Photos with captions | `Note` + attachment | `/photo/edit` |
| **Media** | Audio/video uploads | `Note` + attachment | `/media/edit` |
| **Event** | Calendar events & RSVPs | `Event` | `/event/edit`, `/rsvp/edit` |
| **Checkin** | Location check-ins | `Note` + location | `/checkin/edit` |
| **Like** | Bookmarks / likes | `Note` | `/like/edit` |
| **StaticPages** | CMS-style static pages | N/A (not federated) | `/staticpages/edit`, `/pages/{slug}` |

Each content plugin has an `Entry.php` entity class that defines
`getActivityStreamsObjectType()` and content-specific behavior.

## Feature Plugins

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **ActivityPub** | Fediverse federation (see below) |
| **IndiePub** | IndieAuth + Micropub server |
| **Bridgy** | POSSE syndication via Bridgy |
| **Webhooks** | Outgoing webhooks on content events |
| **Styles** | Custom CSS admin interface |

## ActivityPub Plugin

`IdnoPlugins/ActivityPub/` — Full W3C ActivityPub server implementation.

### Key files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Main.php` | Route registration, event hooks for save/update/delete → federation |
| `ActivityBuilder.php` | Builds outgoing activities (Create, Update, Delete, Accept) and objects (Note, Article, Event) |
| `ActivityHandler.php` | Processes incoming inbox activities (Follow, Undo, Delete, QuoteRequest) |
| `Delivery.php` | Signs and POSTs activities to remote inboxes; fan-out to followers via queue |
| `HTTPSignature.php` | HTTP Signature signing (draft-cavage) and verification |
| `RemoteActor.php` | Fetches and parses remote actor profiles, keys |
| `Pages/Actor.php` | Actor profile endpoint (Person object) |
| `Pages/Inbox.php` | Per-user inbox (POST handling with CSRF bypass) |
| `Pages/SharedInbox.php` | Shared inbox for multi-user delivery |
| `Pages/Outbox.php` | Paginated outbox (OrderedCollection of Create activities) |
| `Pages/Followers.php` | Followers collection |
| `Pages/Following.php` | Following collection |
| `Pages/QuoteStamp.php` | QuoteAuthorization stamp verification endpoint (FEP-044f) |
| `Pages/NodeInfo.php` | NodeInfo 2.0 metadata |
| `Entities/ActivityPubFollower.php` | Follower record entity |

### Routes

```
/actor/{handle}               Person profile
/actor/{handle}/inbox         Per-user inbox
/actor/{handle}/outbox        Outbox (paginated OrderedCollection)
/actor/{handle}/followers     Followers collection
/actor/{handle}/following     Following collection
/inbox                        Shared inbox
/activitypub/quote-stamp      Quote authorization stamp (FEP-044f)
/.well-known/nodeinfo          NodeInfo discovery
/nodeinfo/2.0                 NodeInfo document
/admin/activitypub            Admin panel
```

### Federation flow

1. **Outgoing**: When an entity is saved/updated/deleted, `Main.php` hooks build
   the activity via `ActivityBuilder` and call `Delivery::deliverToFollowers()`
   which enqueues signed POSTs to each follower's inbox.
2. **Incoming**: `ActivityHandler::handle()` verifies HTTP signatures, routes by
   activity type, and processes Follow (auto-accept), Undo, Delete, QuoteRequest.
3. **Quote posts (FEP-044f)**: All outgoing notes include
   `interactionPolicy.canQuote.automaticApproval` set to `as:Public`. Incoming
   QuoteRequests are auto-accepted with an HMAC-signed stamp URL. The stamp
   endpoint serves `QuoteAuthorization` objects for third-party verification.
4. **Context**: Activities use the GoToSocial namespace (`gts:`) for interaction
   policies. The extended `CONTEXT_WITH_QUOTES` constant in `ActivityBuilder`
   defines all required JSON-LD terms.

### Patterns to follow

- Activities are plain PHP arrays, not ORM objects — `ActivityBuilder` returns arrays
- Use `Delivery::deliverToFollowers()` for fan-out (it enqueues via the async queue)
- Use `ActivityBuilder::wrapActivity()` to wrap objects in activity envelopes
- New inbox activity types: add a `case` to the switch in `ActivityHandler::handle()`
  and a corresponding `private static function handleXxx()` method
- The `ActivityBuilder::CONTEXT_WITH_QUOTES` constant is the canonical `@context`
  for all outgoing activities

## IndieWeb Standards

| Standard | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Webmention** | `Idno\Core\Webmention` — sends and receives webmentions; endpoint at `/webmention/endpoint` |
| **Micropub** | `IdnoPlugins\IndiePub` — full Micropub server at `/micropub/endpoint` |
| **IndieAuth** | `IdnoPlugins\IndiePub` — authorization at `/indieauth/auth`, token at `/indieauth/token` |
| **Webfinger** | `Idno\Core\Webfinger` — `/.well-known/webfinger` endpoint |
| **Microformats2** | Templates emit `h-entry`, `h-card`, `h-event` markup; `mf2/mf2` parser included |
| **PubSubHubbub** | `Idno\Core\PubSubHubbub` — real-time feed notification |
| **POSSE** | `Idno\Core\Syndication` — syndicate to external services; Bridgy plugin for backfeed |

## Code Style

- PHP 8.2+ required; uses PSR-4 autoloading (`Idno\`, `IdnoPlugins\`, `Themes\`, `ConsolePlugins\`)
- Namespace hierarchy matches directory structure exactly
- Entity properties are dynamic (magic `__get`/`__set` via `$this->attributes` array)
- Plugins use braced namespace blocks: `namespace IdnoPlugins\Foo { class Main extends \Idno\Common\Plugin { } }`
- Core uses indented namespace blocks (historical style)
- Use `\Idno\Core\Idno::site()->logging()->info()` / `warning()` / `error()` for logging
- Always pass `$overrideAccess = true` to `save()` on system-level entities (queue events, followers)
  to bypass `canEdit()` checks when no user session exists

## Configuration

- Primary config: `config.ini` (INI format, gitignored)
- Environment variables: loaded from `.env` via `vlucas/phpdotenv`
- Key settings: `database`, `dbname`, `dbhost`, `dbuser`, `dbpass`, `event_queue`,
  `filesystem`, `uploadpath`, `site_secret`
- `event_queue = 'AsynchronousQueue'` enables the async pipeline (required for ActivityPub)
- Sensitive files: `.env`, `config.ini`, `configuration/` — never commit these

## Security

- Entity access control via `canEdit()` / `canRead()` / access groups
- HTTP Signatures (draft-cavage-http-signatures) for all ActivityPub federation
- CSRF tokens on all form POSTs (inbox endpoints bypass via `post()` override)
- HTML sanitization via HTMLPurifier
- Content Security Policy headers via template system
- **Never commit** `.env`, `config.ini`, or anything in `configuration/`

## Git Conventions

- `IdnoPlugins/` is gitignored with explicit `!` exceptions for each tracked plugin
- `ConsolePlugins/` follows the same pattern
- `vendor/` is gitignored — use `composer install` to restore
- New plugin files must be `git add -f` due to the gitignore pattern
- `*.json` is gitignored (except `composer.json` which was tracked before the rule)

## Indieweb compatibility

All content is published as HTML, with Microformats2 markup. Any new content types 
that are publicly accessible should  include appropriate microformats classes: 
h-entry, h-card, h-event as appropriate.

## Agents code

Idno allows code that has been generated using AI models. When new code is written, 
it should be tested using the existing test suite. New tests MUST always be written
for new code, and existing tests MUST always pass. When there are architectural changes, 
the existing tests MUST be updated, and appropriate edits MUST be made to AGENTS.md.
